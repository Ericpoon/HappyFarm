Warm welcome! This is the index page of Happy Farm.

For the frontend (web app), we need to know (for now):

- Elements:
    What to present in the website?
        Farms' basic information (name, type of crop, ...)

    How do we present them
        Chart? Map? ...?
        This is very important because this will directly affect the UX

- Functions/Features (more related to user interactions, how user interact with web app to use the features we provide):
    What functions do we have in the website or what should our web app do?
        Both implementation model and mental model (data visualization, ...?)

- Layout:
    This is based on the elements we need to show and the functions we have.
        may need to see some examples, like other websites and web apps
        this could be easily changed later, but it's good to decide earlier

<hr>
What we can come up with later:

- All things related to graphic design (Layout, Color, Animation, Font, ...)
    BUT we need to make decision on UI, UX earlier

<hr>
What we need to know about backend (not in a hurry):

- What data do we need to store in our database?
    (temperature, humidity, ...)

- What's the frequency we may collect data and store them into the database?
